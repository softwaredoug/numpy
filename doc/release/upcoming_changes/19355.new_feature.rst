`np.bit_count` to compute the number of 1-bits in an integer
------------------------------------------------------------

This new function counts the number of 1-bits in a number.
These work on all the numpy integer types, as well as the
builtin arbitrary-precision `Decimal` and `long` types.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> a = np.array([2**i - 1 for i in range(16)])
    >>> np.bit_count(a)
    array([ 0,  1,  2,  3,  4,  5,  6,  7,  8,  9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15],
          dtype=uint8)
